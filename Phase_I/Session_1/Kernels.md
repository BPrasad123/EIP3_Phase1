# Kernels

In convolution, the filter matrix operating on the image matrix is called Kernel. Depending on what features to be extracted, pixel values in the matrix are decided. In general, size of kernel is less than that of image matrix, hence the kernel strides across the entire image to capture features.

In CNN, to capture more complex features, it automatically decides the values in those kernels. With increased number of kernels more feature types are extracted and while scaling down, CNN selects kernels corresponding to only dominating features.
