# Convolution



Convolution is an application of one function on another resulting in a modified version of the later, as intuitively illustrated below image.

Similarly, feature detecting filter matrices are applied on an image matrix, each extracting corresponding features by giving more weights to detected feature prixel values and very less to others.

Generally the size of a filter is smaller than that of the image, hence the filter is strided across the entire image matrix to do convolution in patches.
